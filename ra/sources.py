    Set up the sound sources
    Each sound source object has two main categories of data:
    A - sound source properties (given by user - read from toml):
    1:  coord - the 3D position of the receiver.
        orientation - the orientation of the receiver.
        power_dB - sound power in dB (len(contrlos.freq x 1)
        eq_dB - sound power equalization in dB (len(contrlos.freq x 1)
        power_lin - sound power in Watts (len(contrlos.freq x 1)
        delay - sound source delay [s].
    B - a std::vector of rays (objects). Each ray object contains:
        1: planes_hist - the history of planes indexes found during
            the ray travell in the room (1 x N_max_ref)
        2: refpts_hist - the history of reflection points found during
            the ray travell in the room (N_max_ref x 3 - floats) 
        3: a std::vector of reccross. Each recs object will contain 
            all source-ray-receiver relative data, such as:
                time_cross - the time instants for which a receiver is
                crossed for a given sound source and for a given ray.
                rad_cross - the receiver radius at the instant a receiver
                is crossed for a given sound source and for a given ray.
                ref_order - the reflection order at the instant a receiver
                is crossed for a given sound source and for a given ray.
    This way there is a dependence source-ray-receiver
