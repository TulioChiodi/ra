    Set up the receivers. There are two arrays of receivers.
    1: receivers - contains a receiver object with the properties:
        coord - the 3D position of the receiver.
        orientation - the orientation of the receiver.
    2: reccross - this object will contain all source-ray-receiver
        relative data, such as:
        time_cross - the time instants for which a receiver is crossed
        for a given sound source and for a given ray.
        rad_cross - the receiver radius at the instant a receiver is crossed
        for a given sound source and for a given ray.
        ref_order - the reflection order at the instant a receiver is crossed
        for a given sound source and for a given ray.
        An std::vector of reccross objects will be passed to each ray
        object, generating an std::vector of rays. These rays will be
        passed to each source object. This will generate the dependence
        source-ray-receiver
