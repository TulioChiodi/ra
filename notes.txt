Geometrical Acoutics based on the Ray Tracing Method
----------------------------------------------------

1-
    * determine the inital direction and energy for each ray (start with a
    sphere tessellation)

2-
    * determine the next plane the ray will hit (point-in-polygon test)
    * determine with how much energy it hits the target considering attenuation
    due to the absorption of the air and the length of the travelled path
    * determine how much energy is absorbed by the wall considering the angle of
    incidence
    * determine the new direction of the ray upon reflection considering the
    scattering coefficient (becoming specular or diffuse)
    * check if the energy of the ray is below a certain threshold considering
    the reverberation time (a decay of 60dB)

3-
    * determine if any of the receivers were crossed and for how long (and
    length)
